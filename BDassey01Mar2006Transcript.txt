FASSBENDER: and ah, I kinda call it, it’s a sense to breathe being in a way, and I’ll just let you talk to us a little and um, and, and we’ve had also a chance for two days now to look at what you said and, and listen to the to tapes a little and stuff like that and, and we look at that and we say, well you know, Brendan gave us, honestly gave us this information, this information and that information, maybe I’ll call them dots or whatever and some of the dots when we look at it say well, I think we need some matching up here, just a little tightening up or something. We, we feel that, that maybe, I think Mark and I both feel that maybe there’s a, some more that you could tell us, um, that you may have held back for whatever reasons and I wanna assure you that Mark and I both are in your corner, we're on your side, and you did tell us yourself that one of the reasons you hadn’t come forward yet was because you’re afraid, you’re scared, and, and one of the reasons you were scared was that you would be implicated in this, or people would say that you helped or did this (Brendan nods “yes”)
BRENDAN: mm huh. (nods “yes”)
FASSBENDER: OK, and that you might get arrested and stuff like that. OK? And we understand that. One of the best ways to, ta prove to us or more importantly, you know, the courts and stuff is that you tell the whole truth, don’t leave anything out, don’t make anything up because you’re trying to cover something up, a little, um, and even if those statements are against your own interest, you know what I mean, that, then makes you might, i-it might make you look a little bad or make you look like you were more involved than you wannabe, aah, looked at, um, it’s hard to do but it’s good from that vantage point to say hey, there’s no doubt you’re telling the truth because you've now given the whole story you’ve even given points where it didn’t look real good for you either, an, and I don’t know if I, if you,your understanding what I’m saying (Brendan nods “yes”)
BRENDAN: mm huh. (nods “yes”)
FASSBENDER: and, and that’s why we kinda came here, to let you talk a little, maybe get some stuff off your mind or chest if you need to and then to tell us the whole truth, to take us through this whole thing that happened on Monday, not leaving anything out, not adding anything in, because if our guy looked at, looked at the tapes, looked at the notes, it’s real obvious there’s some places where some things were left out or maybe changed just a bitta, to maybe lookin' at yourself to protect yourself a little. Um, from what I’m seeing, even if I filled those in, I’m thinkin' you're all right. OK, you don’t have to worry about things. Um, w, were there for ya, um, and I, and, and we know what Steven did an, and, and we know kinda what happened to you when he did, we just need to hear the whole story from you. As soon as we get that and we’re comfortable with that, I think you’re gonna be a lot more comfortable with that. It’s going to be a lot easier on you down the road, ah, if this goes to trial and stuff like that. We need to know that, because it’s probably going to come out. Think of Steven for a second, Steven is already starting to say some things and eventually he is gonna potentially lay some crap on you and try and make it look like you are the bad person here. Um, and we don’t want that,
SΤΑΤΕ4611
________________
CALUMET COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
05–0157-955
we want everything out in front so we can say yeah we knew that Steven. He told us that. So, ya, you know that you get my drift. I’m a, I know Mark has some, so I’m just going to give you an opportunity to talk to us now and, and kinda fill in those gaps for us. (Brendan nods “yes”)
WIEGERT: Honesty here Brendan is the thing that’s gonna help you. OK, no matter what you did, we can work through that. OK. We can’t make any promises but we’ll stand behind you no matter what you did. OK. Because you’re being the good guy here. You're the one that’s saying you know what? Maybe I made some mistakes but here’s what I did. The other guy involved in this doesn’t want to help himself. All he wants to do is blame everybody else. OK. And by you talking with us, it’s, it’s helping you. OK? Because the honest person is the one who’s gonna get a better deal out of everything. You know how that works. (Brendan nods
“yes”) -
BRENDAN: mm hm. (nods “yes”)
WIEGERT: You know. Honesty is the only thing that will set you free. Right? And we know, like Tom said we know, we reviewed those tapes. We know there’s some things you left out and we know there’s some things that maybe weren’t quite correct that you told us. OK. We’ve done, we’ve been investigating this a long time. We pretty much know everything that’s why we’re to talking to you again today. We really need you to be honest this time with everything, OK. If, in fact, you did somethings, which we believe, somethings may have happened that you didn’t wanna tell us about. It's OK. As long as you can, as long as you be honest with us, it's OK. If you lie about it that’s gonna be problems. OK. Does that sound fair? (Brendan nods “yes”)
BRENDAN: mm hum (nods “yes”)
WIEGERT: All right. Should we just go through that whole day again on the 31* or how do you wanna do it?
FASSBENDER: We can that a...... try to give him a chance to just talk to us and
WIEGERT: Sure,
FASSBENDER: if he wants to go through the whole day, if he wants to fill in the pieces, that’s, that’s up to Brendan right now.
WIEGERT: What would you rather do?
FASSBENDER: Just wanna to talk to us and tell us and startin’ with that day and how you
actually came to know what happened and stuff. Cuz, I already know you were in the garage and stuff apparently cleaning up and stuff so tell us about that. (Brendan nods “yes”)

(pause) I have a question for yous two. Is there any way that I can talk to him. Not him, the other one,
WEGERT: As in Steve you mean?
BARB JANDA: Yes.
WEGERT: The only way we can have you talk to him is if he calls you or if its, you know, you go there for visiting.
BARB JANDA: I won't go there and visit.
WIEGERT: OK. That’s the only way. I-I have no other way of, you know, I-H can’t hook you up to him or anything like that. I’m not allowed to do that. If he calls you, you can do what you want or if you go there for visiting, you know that’s up to you.
BARB JANDA: Were you pressuring him?
WIEGERT: Who are you talking about?
CA; UMET COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
Page 673 Complaint No, File Number 05-0457-955
BARH JANDA: Him.
WEGERT: What do you mean, pressuring him?
BARB JANDA: In talking to him.
WEGERT: No we told him we needed to know the truth. We’ve been doing this job a
long time Barb and we can tell when people aren’t telling the truth. And, in my opinion, he'd never be able to five with himself if he didn’t tell somebody. There's no way, he could’ve live with that. Nobody could live with that. I think Brendan knows that.
WIEGERT: Brendan, you need to use the bathroom or anything? (Brendan shakes head “no")
BARB JANTA: When are you going out to my house then?
WEGERT: As soon as we can leave here, we’ll go out there. I don’t think we’re gonna bring Brendan out there though. I-I just don’t think that’s a good idea. I don’t think he needs to be exposed to that or be out there anymore, (door opens and closes) It's not gonna do him any good.
BARB JANDA: So what you’re sayin’ is if, when he gets out, it wouldn’t be a good idea for him to be there, at all.
WEGERT: I-You know, I can’t tell you where for you guys to five, but what do you
think? Do you think it’s a good idea for bim to next where this stuff occurred?
BARB JANDA: I-I don’t wanna be there, but I can’t afford another place.
WEGERT: I know.
BARE JANDA: I mean that’s $80,000 I owe yet.
WIEGERT: I understand.
WIEGERT: It’s a shitty, shitty spot to be in.
BARB JANDA: And nobody’s gonna buy it.

somethin’ I can do to help ya, I certainiy wiłł. (pause) Maybe you should look into movin' the house,

BARB JANDA: I can’t afford it.
WIEGERT: We-who knows, you don’t even know what it’ll cost, depends on where
you move it.
BARB JANDA: Quite a bit. (pause) An extra $16,000 for another basement. (pause) So what did you all help him with? Can I ask? Will you tell me? Brendan? Did you do it willingly? Huh? (Brendan shakes head “no”) (pause) He did tell me one time, Steven, he told me that probably one or two of my kids would not graduate.
WIEGERT: Steven told you that?
BARB JANDA: Yeah. This was before this all even happened. So he must have had it all planned.
WIEGERT: That’s very possible, very possible. (pause)
BARB JANDA: You don’t know how much hatred I got right now.
WIEGERT: You’re right, I don’t. I can only imagine. I-I can’t even put myself in your shoes Barb, I can’t.
BARB JANDA: My oldest son is gonna flip. I can’t even tell him. I can’t.
